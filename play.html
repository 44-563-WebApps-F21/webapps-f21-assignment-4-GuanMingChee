            The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
            happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
            leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
            space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
            absolutely worn to shadows.

            Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
           to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.

            It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
           escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their power and use it.
