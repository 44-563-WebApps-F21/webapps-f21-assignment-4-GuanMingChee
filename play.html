            SCENE


            _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.
                                          _Door_ R.C.

           [_Ladies seated on sofas_.]

           <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
           little!
           
           <h5>LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?
           
           <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  Persecute us?  I wish they did.
           
           <h5>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  My dear!
           
           <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5> The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
           happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
           leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
           space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
           absolutely worn to shadows.

           [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]
           </p>
           
           <p>
           <h5>LADY HUNSTANTON.</h5>  Worn to shadows, dear?
           
           <h5>MRS. ALLONBY.</h5>  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
           to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.
           
           <h5>LADY STUTFIELD.</h5>  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
           escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
           power and use it.
           
           <h5>LADY CAROLINE.</h5>  <p>[_Takes coffee from Servant_.]</p>  What stuff and nonsense
           all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
           place.
