            SCENE

            _Drawing-room at Hunstanton_, _after dinner_, _lamps lit_.  _Door_ L.C.
                                          _Door_ R.C.
           
           [_Ladies seated on sofas_.]
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  What a comfort it is to have got rid of the men for a
           little!
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men persecute us dreadfully, don’t they?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Persecute us?  I wish they did.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  The annoying thing is that the wretches can be perfectly
           happy without us.  That is why I think it is every woman’s duty never to
           leave them alone for a single moment, except during this short breathing
           space after dinner; without which I believe we poor women would be
           absolutely worn to shadows.
           
           [_Enter Servants with coffee_.]
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Worn to shadows, dear?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton.  It is such a strain keeping men up
           to the mark.  They are always trying to escape from us.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  It seems to me that it is we who are always trying to
           escape from them.  Men are so very, very heartless.  They know their
           power and use it.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  What stuff and nonsense
           all this about men is!  The thing to do is to keep men in their proper
           place.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  But what is their proper place, Lady Caroline?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  Looking after their wives, Mrs. Allonby.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Takes coffee from Servant_.]  Really?  And if they’re
           not married?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  If they are not married, they should be looking after a
           wife.  It’s perfectly scandalous the amount of bachelors who are going
           about society.  There should be a law passed to compel them all to marry
           within twelve months.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  [_Refuses coffee_.]  But if they’re in love with some
           one who, perhaps, is tied to another?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  In that case, Lady Stutfield, they should be married off
           in a week to some plain respectable girl, in order to teach them not to
           meddle with other people’s property.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  I don’t think that we should ever be spoken of as other
           people’s property.  All men are married women’s property.  That is the
           only true definition of what married women’s property really is.  But we
           don’t belong to any one.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I am so very, very glad to hear you say so.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  But do you really think, dear Caroline, that
           legislation would improve matters in any way?  I am told that, nowadays,
           all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like
           married men.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  I certainly never know one from the other.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh, I think one can always know at once whether a man
           has home claims upon his life or not.  I have noticed a very, very sad
           expression in the eyes of so many married men.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, all that I have noticed is that they are horribly
           tedious when they are good husbands, and abominably conceited when they
           are not.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Well, I suppose the type of husband has completely
           changed since my young days, but I’m bound to state that poor dear
           Hunstanton was the most delightful of creatures, and as good as gold.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, my husband is a sort of promissory note; I’m tired of
           meeting him.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  But you renew him from time to time, don’t you?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh no, Lady Caroline.  I have only had one husband as yet.
           I suppose you look upon me as quite an amateur.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  With your views on life I wonder you married at all.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  So do I.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, I believe you are really very happy in
           your married life, but that you like to hide your happiness from others.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  I assure you I was horribly deceived in Ernest.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, I hope not, dear.  I knew his mother quite well.
           She was a Stratton, Caroline, one of Lord Crowland’s daughters.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  Victoria Stratton?  I remember her perfectly.  A silly
           fair-haired woman with no chin.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, Ernest has a chin.  He has a very strong chin, a
           square chin.  Ernest’s chin is far too square.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  But do you really think a man’s chin can be too square?
           I think a man should look very, very strong, and that his chin should be
           quite, quite square.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Then you should certainly know Ernest, Lady Stutfield.  It
           is only fair to tell you beforehand he has got no conversation at all.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  I adore silent men.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Ernest isn’t silent.  He talks the whole time.  But he
           has got no conversation.  What he talks about I don’t know.  I haven’t
           listened to him for years.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Have you never forgiven him then?  How sad that seems!
           But all life is very, very sad, is it not?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Life, Lady Stutfield, is simply a _mauvais quart d’heure_
           made up of exquisite moments.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, there are moments, certainly.  But was it something
           very, very wrong that Mr. Allonby did?  Did he become angry with you, and
           say anything that was unkind or true?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh dear, no.  Ernest is invariably calm.  That is one of
           the reasons he always gets on my nerves.  Nothing is so aggravating as
           calmness.  There is something positively brutal about the good temper of
           most modern men.  I wonder we women stand it as well as we do.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes; men’s good temper shows they are not so sensitive
           as we are, not so finely strung.  It makes a great barrier often between
           husband and wife, does it not?  But I would so much like to know what was
           the wrong thing Mr. Allonby did.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Well, I will tell you, if you solemnly promise to tell
           everybody else.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  I will make a point of repeating
           it.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  When Ernest and I were engaged, he swore to me positively
           on his knees that he had never loved any one before in the whole course
           of his life.  I was very young at the time, so I didn’t believe him, I
           needn’t tell you.  Unfortunately, however, I made no enquiries of any
           kind till after I had been actually married four or five months.  I found
           out then that what he had told me was perfectly true.  And that sort of
           thing makes a man so absolutely uninteresting.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Men always want to be a woman’s first love.  That is their
           clumsy vanity.  We women have a more subtle instinct about things.  What
           we like is to be a man’s last romance.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  I see what you mean.  It’s very, very beautiful.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear child, you don’t mean to tell me that you won’t
           forgive your husband because he never loved any one else?  Did you ever
           hear such a thing, Caroline?  I am quite surprised.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  Oh, women have become so highly educated, Jane, that
           nothing should surprise us nowadays, except happy marriages.  They
           apparently are getting remarkably rare.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, they’re quite out of date.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Except amongst the middle classes, I have been told.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  How like the middle classes!
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes—is it not?—very, very like them.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  If what you tell us about the middle classes is true,
           Lady Stutfield, it redounds greatly to their credit.  It is much to be
           regretted that in our rank of life the wife should be so persistently
           frivolous, under the impression apparently that it is the proper thing to
           be.  It is to that I attribute the unhappiness of so many marriages we
           all know of in society.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Do you know, Lady Caroline, I don’t think the frivolity of
           the wife has ever anything to do with it. More marriages are ruined
           nowadays by the common sense of the husband than by anything else.  How
           can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating
           her as if she were a perfectly rational being?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear!
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Man, poor, awkward, reliable, necessary man belongs to a
           sex that has been rational for millions and millions of years.  He can’t
           help himself.  It is in his race.  The History of Woman is very
           different.  We have always been picturesque protests against the mere
           existence of common sense.  We saw its dangers from the first.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, the common sense of husbands is certainly most,
           most trying.  Do tell me your conception of the Ideal Husband.  I think
           it would be so very, very helpful.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Husband?  There couldn’t be such a thing.  The
           institution is wrong.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  The Ideal Man, then, in his relations to _us_.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  He would probably be extremely realistic.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  The Ideal Man!  Oh, the Ideal Man should talk to us as if
           we were goddesses, and treat us as if we were children.  He should refuse
           all our serious requests, and gratify every one of our whims.  He should
           encourage us to have caprices, and forbid us to have missions.  He should
           always say much more than he means, and always mean much more than he
           says.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  But how could he do both, dear?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  He should never run down other pretty women.  That would
           show he had no taste, or make one suspect that he had too much.  No; he
           should be nice about them all, but say that somehow they don’t attract
           him.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Yes, that is always very, very pleasant to hear about
           other women.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  If we ask him a question about anything, he should give us
           an answer all about ourselves.  He should invariably praise us for
           whatever qualities he knows we haven’t got.  But he should be pitiless,
           quite pitiless, in reproaching us for the virtues that we have never
           dreamed of possessing.  He should never believe that we know the use of
           useful things.  That would be unforgiveable.  But he should shower on us
           everything we don’t want.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  As far as I can see, he is to do nothing but pay bills
           and compliments.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  He should persistently compromise us in public, and treat
           us with absolute respect when we are alone.  And yet he should be always
           ready to have a perfectly terrible scene, whenever we want one, and to
           become miserable, absolutely miserable, at a moment’s notice, and to
           overwhelm us with just reproaches in less than twenty minutes, and to be
           positively violent at the end of half an hour, and to leave us for ever
           at a quarter to eight, when we have to go and dress for dinner.  And
           when, after that, one has seen him for really the last time, and he has
           refused to take back the little things he has given one, and promised
           never to communicate with one again, or to write one any foolish letters,
           he should be perfectly broken-hearted, and telegraph to one all day long,
           and send one little notes every half-hour by a private hansom, and dine
           quite alone at the club, so that every one should know how unhappy he
           was.  And after a whole dreadful week, during which one has gone about
           everywhere with one’s husband, just to show how absolutely lonely one
           was, he may be given a third last parting, in the evening, and then, if
           his conduct has been quite irreproachable, and one has behaved really
           badly to him, he should be allowed to admit that he has been entirely in
           the wrong, and when he has admitted that, it becomes a woman’s duty to
           forgive, and one can do it all over again from the beginning, with
           variations.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  How clever you are, my dear!  You never mean a single
           word you say.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Thank you, thank you.  It has been quite, quite
           entrancing.  I must try and remember it all.  There are such a number of
           details that are so very, very important.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  But you have not told us yet what the reward of the Ideal
           Man is to be.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  His reward?  Oh, infinite expectation.  That is quite
           enough for him.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  But men are so terribly, terribly exacting, are they
           not?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  That makes no matter.  One should never surrender.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Not even to the Ideal Man?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Certainly not to him.  Unless, of course, one wants to
           grow tired of him.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Oh! . . . yes.  I see that.  It is very, very helpful.
           Do you think, Mrs. Allonby, I shall ever meet the Ideal Man?  Or are
           there more than one?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  There are just four in London, Lady Stutfield.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, my dear!
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  [_Going over to her_.]  What has happened?  Do tell me.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON [_in a low voice_]  I had completely forgotten that the
           American young lady has been in the room all the time.  I am afraid some
           of this clever talk may have shocked her a little.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Ah, that will do her so much good!
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Let us hope she didn’t understand much.  I think I had
           better go over and talk to her.  [_Rises and goes across to_ HESTER
           WORSLEY.]  Well, dear Miss Worsley. [_Sitting down beside her_.]  How
           quiet you have been in your nice little corner all this time!  I suppose
           you have been reading a book?  There are so many books here in the
           library.
           
           HESTER.  No, I have been listening to the conversation.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  You mustn’t believe everything that was said, you know,
           dear.
           
           HESTER.  I didn’t believe any of it.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  That is quite right, dear.
           
           HESTER.  [_Continuing_.]  I couldn’t believe that any women could really
           hold such views of life as I have heard to-night from some of your
           guests.  [_An awkward pause_.]
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  I hear you have such pleasant society in America.
           Quite like our own in places, my son wrote to me.
           
           HESTER.  There are cliques in America as elsewhere, Lady Hunstanton.  But
           true American society consists simply of all the good women and good men
           we have in our country.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  What a sensible system, and I dare say quite pleasant
           too.  I am afraid in England we have too many artificial social barriers.
           We don’t see as much as we should of the middle and lower classes.
           
           HESTER.  In America we have no lower classes.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Really?  What a very strange arrangement!
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  What is that dreadful girl talking about?
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  She is painfully natural, is she not?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  There are a great many things you haven’t got in America,
           I am told, Miss Worsley.  They say you have no ruins, and no curiosities.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  [_To_ LADY STUTFIELD.]  What nonsense!  They have their
           mothers and their manners.
           
           HESTER.  The English aristocracy supply us with our curiosities, Lady
           Caroline.  They are sent over to us every summer, regularly, in the
           steamers, and propose to us the day after they land.  As for ruins, we
           are trying to build up something that will last longer than brick or
           stone.  [_Gets up to take her fan from table_.]
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  What is that, dear?  Ah, yes, an iron Exhibition, is it
           not, at that place that has the curious name?
           
           HESTER.  [_Standing by table_.]  We are trying to build up life, Lady
           Hunstanton, on a better, truer, purer basis than life rests on here.
           This sounds strange to you all, no doubt.  How could it sound other than
           strange?  You rich people in England, you don’t know how you are living.
           How could you know?  You shut out from your society the gentle and the
           good.  You laugh at the simple and the pure.  Living, as you all do, on
           others and by them, you sneer at self-sacrifice, and if you throw bread
           to the poor, it is merely to keep them quiet for a season.  With all your
           pomp and wealth and art you don’t know how to live—you don’t even know
           that.  You love the beauty that you can see and touch and handle, the
           beauty that you can destroy, and do destroy, but of the unseen beauty of
           life, of the unseen beauty of a higher life, you know nothing.  You have
           lost life’s secret.  Oh, your English society seems to me shallow,
           selfish, foolish.  It has blinded its eyes, and stopped its ears.  It
           lies like a leper in purple.  It sits like a dead thing smeared with
           gold.  It is all wrong, all wrong.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  I don’t think one should know of these things.  It is
           not very, very nice, is it?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Miss Worsley, I thought you liked English
           society so much.  You were such a success in it.  And you were so much
           admired by the best people.  I quite forget what Lord Henry Weston said
           of you—but it was most complimentary, and you know what an authority he
           is on beauty.
           
           HESTER.  Lord Henry Weston!  I remember him, Lady Hunstanton.  A man with
           a hideous smile and a hideous past.  He is asked everywhere.  No
           dinner-party is complete without him.  What of those whose ruin is due to
           him?  They are outcasts.  They are nameless.  If you met them in the
           street you would turn your head away.  I don’t complain of their
           punishment.  Let all women who have sinned be punished.
           
           [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _enters from terrace behind in a cloak with a lace veil
           over her head_.  _She hears the last words and starts_.]
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady!
           
           HESTER.  It is right that they should be punished, but don’t let them be
           the only ones to suffer.  If a man and woman have sinned, let them both
           go forth into the desert to love or loathe each other there.  Let them
           both be branded.  Set a mark, if you wish, on each, but don’t punish the
           one and let the other go free.  Don’t have one law for men and another
           for women.  You are unjust to women in England.  And till you count what
           is a shame in a woman to be an infamy in a man, you will always be
           unjust, and Right, that pillar of fire, and Wrong, that pillar of cloud,
           will be made dim to your eyes, or be not seen at all, or if seen, not
           regarded.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  Might I, dear Miss Worsley, as you are standing up, ask
           you for my cotton that is just behind you?  Thank you.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear Mrs. Arbuthnot!  I am so pleased you have come
           up.  But I didn’t hear you announced.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, I came straight in from the terrace, Lady Hunstanton,
           just as I was.  You didn’t tell me you had a party.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Not a party.  Only a few guests who are staying in the
           house, and whom you must know.  Allow me.  [_Tries to help her_.  _Rings
           bell_.]  Caroline, this is Mrs. Arbuthnot, one of my sweetest friends.
           Lady Caroline Pontefract, Lady Stutfield, Mrs. Allonby, and my young
           American friend, Miss Worsley, who has just been telling us all how
           wicked we are.
           
           HESTER.  I am afraid you think I spoke too strongly, Lady Hunstanton.
           But there are some things in England—
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  My dear young lady, there was a great deal of truth, I
           dare say, in what you said, and you looked very pretty while you said it,
           which is much more important, Lord Illingworth would tell us.  The only
           point where I thought you were a little hard was about Lady Caroline’s
           brother, about poor Lord Henry.  He is really such good company.
           
           [_Enter Footman_.]
           
           Take Mrs. Arbuthnot’s things.
           
           [_Exit Footman with wraps_.]
           
           HESTER.  Lady Caroline, I had no idea it was your brother.  I am sorry
           for the pain I must have caused you—I—
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  My dear Miss Worsley, the only part of your little
           speech, if I may so term it, with which I thoroughly agreed, was the part
           about my brother.  Nothing that you could possibly say could be too bad
           for him.  I regard Henry as infamous, absolutely infamous.  But I am
           bound to state, as you were remarking, Jane, that he is excellent
           company, and he has one of the best cooks in London, and after a good
           dinner one can forgive anybody, even one’s own relations.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON [_to_ MISS WORSLEY]  Now, do come, dear, and make friends
           with Mrs. Arbuthnot.  She is one of the good, sweet, simple people you
           told us we never admitted into society.  I am sorry to say Mrs. Arbuthnot
           comes very rarely to me.  But that is not my fault.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  What a bore it is the men staying so long after dinner!  I
           expect they are saying the most dreadful things about us.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  Do you really think so?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  I was sure of it.
           
           LADY STUTFIELD.  How very, very horrid of them!  Shall we go onto the
           terrace?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, anything to get away from the dowagers and the
           dowdies.  [_Rises and goes with_ LADY STUTFIELD _to door_ L.C.]  We are
           only going to look at the stars, Lady Hunstanton.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  You will find a great many, dear, a great many.  But
           don’t catch cold.  [_To_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  We shall all miss Gerald so
           much, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  But has Lord Illingworth really offered to make Gerald
           his secretary?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Oh, yes!  He has been most charming about it.  He has
           the highest possible opinion of your boy.  You don’t know Lord
           Illingworth, I believe, dear.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have never met him.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  You know him by name, no doubt?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am afraid I don’t.  I live so much out of the world,
           and see so few people.  I remember hearing years ago of an old Lord
           Illingworth who lived in Yorkshire, I think.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, yes.  That would be the last Earl but one.  He was
           a very curious man.  He wanted to marry beneath him.  Or wouldn’t, I
           believe.  There was some scandal about it.  The present Lord Illingworth
           is quite different.  He is very distinguished.  He does—well, he does
           nothing, which I am afraid our pretty American visitor here thinks very
           wrong of anybody, and I don’t know that he cares much for the subjects in
           which you are so interested, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot.  Do you think,
           Caroline, that Lord Illingworth is interested in the Housing of the Poor?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  I should fancy not at all, Jane.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  We all have our different tastes, have we not?  But
           Lord Illingworth has a very high position, and there is nothing he
           couldn’t get if he chose to ask for it.  Of course, he is comparatively a
           young man still, and he has only come to his title within—how long
           exactly is it, Caroline, since Lord Illingworth succeeded?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  About four years, I think, Jane.  I know it was the same
           year in which my brother had his last exposure in the evening newspapers.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I remember.  That would be about four years ago.
           Of course, there were a great many people between the present Lord
           Illingworth and the title, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  There was—who was there,
           Caroline?
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  There was poor Margaret’s baby.  You remember how anxious
           she was to have a boy, and it was a boy, but it died, and her husband
           died shortly afterwards, and she married almost immediately one of Lord
           Ascot’s sons, who, I am told, beats her.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, that is in the family, dear, that is in the family.
           And there was also, I remember, a clergyman who wanted to be a lunatic,
           or a lunatic who wanted to be a clergyman, I forget which, but I know the
           Court of Chancery investigated the matter, and decided that he was quite
           sane.  And I saw him afterwards at poor Lord Plumstead’s with straws in
           his hair, or something very odd about him.  I can’t recall what.  I often
           regret, Lady Caroline, that dear Lady Cecilia never lived to see her son
           get the title.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Cecilia?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Lord Illingworth’s mother, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, was one
           of the Duchess of Jerningham’s pretty daughters, and she married Sir
           Thomas Harford, who wasn’t considered a very good match for her at the
           time, though he was said to be the handsomest man in London.  I knew them
           all quite intimately, and both the sons, Arthur and George.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  It was the eldest son who succeeded, of course, Lady
           Hunstanton?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  No, dear, he was killed in the hunting field.  Or was
           it fishing, Caroline?  I forget.  But George came in for everything.  I
           always tell him that no younger son has ever had such good luck as he has
           had.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lady Hunstanton, I want to speak to Gerald at once.
           Might I see him?  Can he be sent for?
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Certainly, dear.  I will send one of the servants into
           the dining-room to fetch him.  I don’t know what keeps the gentlemen so
           long.  [_Rings bell_.]  When I knew Lord Illingworth first as plain
           George Harford, he was simply a very brilliant young man about town, with
           not a penny of money except what poor dear Lady Cecilia gave him.  She
           was quite devoted to him.  Chiefly, I fancy, because he was on bad terms
           with his father.  Oh, here is the dear Archdeacon.  [_To Servant_.]  It
           doesn’t matter.
           
           [_Enter_ SIR JOHN _and_ DOCTOR DAUBENY.  SIR JOHN _goes over to_ LADY
           STUTFIELD, DOCTOR DAUBENY _to_ LADY HUNSTANTON.]
           
           THE ARCHDEACON.  Lord Illingworth has been most entertaining.  I have
           never enjoyed myself more.  [_Sees_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Ah, Mrs. Arbuthnot.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  [_To_ DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  You see I have got Mrs.
           Arbuthnot to come to me at last.
           
           THE ARCHDEACON.  That is a great honour, Lady Hunstanton.  Mrs. Daubeny
           will be quite jealous of you.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, I am so sorry Mrs. Daubeny could not come with you
           to-night.  Headache as usual, I suppose.
           
           THE ARCHDEACON.  Yes, Lady Hunstanton; a perfect martyr.  But she is
           happiest alone.  She is happiest alone.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  [_To her husband_.]  John!  [SIR JOHN _goes over to his
           wife_.  DOCTOR BAUBENY _talks to_ LADY HUNSTANTON _and_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]
           
           [MRS. ARBUTHNOT watches LORD ILLINGWORTH the whole time.  He has passed
           across the room without noticing her, and approaches MRS. ALLONBY, who
           with LADY STUTFIELD is standing by the door looking on to the terrace.]
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How is the most charming woman in the world?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  [Taking LADY STUTFIELD by the hand.]  We are both quite
           well, thank you, Lord Illingworth.  But what a short time you have been
           in the dining-room!  It seems as if we had only just left.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I was bored to death.  Never opened my lips the whole
           time.  Absolutely longing to come in to you.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  You should have.  The American girl has been giving us a
           lecture.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Really?  All Americans lecture, I believe.  I suppose
           it is something in their climate.  What did she lecture about?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Oh, Puritanism, of course.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I am going to convert her, am I not?  How long do you
           give me?
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  A week.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  A week is more than enough.
           
           [_Enter_ GERALD _and_ LORD ALFRED.]
           
           GERALD.  [_Going to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]  Dear mother!
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald, I don’t feel at all well.  See me home, Gerald.
           I shouldn’t have come.
           
           GERALD.  I am so sorry, mother.  Certainly.  But you must know Lord
           Illingworth first.  [_Goes across room_.]
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Not to-night, Gerald.
           
           GERALD.  Lord Illingworth, I want you so much to know my mother.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  With the greatest pleasure.  [_To_ MRS. ALLONBY.]
           I’ll be back in a moment.  People’s mothers always bore me to death.  All
           women become like their mothers.  That is their tragedy.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  No man does.  That is his.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What a delightful mood you are in to-night!  [_Turns
           round and goes across with_ GERALD _to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  _When he sees
           her_, _he starts back in wonder_.  _Then slowly his eyes turn towards_
           GERALD.]
           
           GERALD.  Mother, this is Lord Illingworth, who has offered to take me as
           his private secretary.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _bows coldly_.]  It is a
           wonderful opening for me, isn’t it?  I hope he won’t be disappointed in
           me, that is all.  You’ll thank Lord Illingworth, mother, won’t you?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth in very good, I am sure, to interest
           himself in you for the moment.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  [_Putting his hand on_ GERALD’S _shoulder_.]  Oh,
           Gerald and I are great friends already, Mrs . . . Arbuthnot.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  There can be nothing in common between you and my son,
           Lord Illingworth.
           
           GERALD.  Dear mother, how can you say so?  Of course Lord Illingworth is
           awfully clever and that sort of thing.  There is nothing Lord Illingworth
           doesn’t know.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear boy!
           
           GERALD.  He knows more about life than any one I have ever met.  I feel
           an awful duffer when I am with you, Lord Illingworth.  Of course, I have
           had so few advantages.  I have not been to Eton or Oxford like other
           chaps.  But Lord Illingworth doesn’t seem to mind that.  He has been
           awfully good to me, mother.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Lord Illingworth may change his mind.  He may not really
           want you as his secretary.
           
           GERALD.  Mother!
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You must remember, as you said yourself, you have had so
           few advantages.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Lord Illingworth, I want to speak to you for a moment.  Do
           come over.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Will you excuse me, Mrs. Arbuthnot?  Now, don’t let
           your charming mother make any more difficulties, Gerald.  The thing is
           quite settled, isn’t it?
           
           GERALD.  I hope so.  [LORD ILLINGWORTH _goes across to_ MRS. ARBUTHNOT.]
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  I thought you were never going to leave the lady in black
           velvet.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  She is excessively handsome.  [_Looks at_ MRS.
           ARBUTHNOT.]
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Caroline, shall we all make a move to the music-room?
           Miss Worsley is going to play.  You’ll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot,
           won’t you?  You don’t know what a treat is in store for you.  [_To_
           DOCTOR BAUBENY.]  I must really take Miss Worsley down some afternoon to
           the rectory.  I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the
           violin.  Ah, I forgot.  Dear Mrs. Daubeny’s hearing is a little
           defective, is it not?
           
           THE ARCHDEACON.  Her deafness is a great privation to her.  She can’t
           even hear my sermons now.  She reads them at home.  But she has many
           resources in herself, many resources.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  She reads a good deal, I suppose?
           
           THE ARCHDEACON.  Just the very largest print.  The eyesight is rapidly
           going.  But she’s never morbid, never morbid.
           
           GERALD.  [_To_ LORD ILLINGWORTH.]  Do speak to my mother, Lord
           Illingworth, before you go into the music-room.  She seems to think,
           somehow, you don’t mean what you said to me.
           
           MRS. ALLONBY.  Aren’t you coming?
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  In a few moments.  Lady Hunstanton, if Mrs. Arbuthnot
           would allow me, I would like to say a few words to her, and we will join
           you later on.
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Ah, of course.  You will have a great deal to say to
           her, and she will have a great deal to thank you for.  It is not every
           son who gets such an offer, Mrs. Arbuthnot.  But I know you appreciate
           that, dear.
           
           LADY CAROLINE.  John!
           
           LADY HUNSTANTON.  Now, don’t keep Mrs. Arbuthnot too long, Lord
           Illingworth.  We can’t spare her.
           
           [_Exit following the other guests_.  _Sound of violin heard from
           music-room_.]
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  So that is our son, Rachel!  Well, I am very proud of
           him.  He in a Harford, every inch of him.  By the way, why Arbuthnot,
           Rachel?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  One name is as good as another, when one has no right to
           any name.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I suppose so—but why Gerald?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  After a man whose heart I broke—after my father.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Well, Rachel, what is over is over.  All I have got to
           say now in that I am very, very much pleased with our boy.  The world
           will know him merely as my private secretary, but to me he will be
           something very near, and very dear.  It is a curious thing, Rachel; my
           life seemed to be quite complete.  It was not so.  It lacked something,
           it lacked a son.  I have found my son now, I am glad I have found him.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  You have no right to claim him, or the smallest part of
           him.  The boy is entirely mine, and shall remain mine.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, you have had him to yourself for over
           twenty years.  Why not let me have him for a little now?  He is quite as
           much mine as yours.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Are you talking of the child you abandoned?  Of the
           child who, as far as you are concerned, might have died of hunger and of
           want?
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  You forget, Rachel, it was you who left me.  It was
           not I who left you.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I left you because you refused to give the child a name.
           Before my son was born, I implored you to marry me.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I had no expectations then.  And besides, Rachel, I
           wasn’t much older than you were.  I was only twenty-two.  I was
           twenty-one, I believe, when the whole thing began in your father’s
           garden.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  When a man is old enough to do wrong he should be old
           enough to do right also.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, intellectual generalities are always
           interesting, but generalities in morals mean absolutely nothing.  As for
           saying I left our child to starve, that, of course, is untrue and silly.
           My mother offered you six hundred a year.  But you wouldn’t take
           anything.  You simply disappeared, and carried the child away with you.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I wouldn’t have accepted a penny from her.  Your father
           was different.  He told you, in my presence, when we were in Paris, that
           it was your duty to marry me.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Oh, duty is what one expects from others, it is not
           what one does oneself.  Of course, I was influenced by my mother.  Every
           man is when he is young.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I am glad to hear you say so.  Gerald shall certainly
           not go away with you.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  What nonsense, Rachel!
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Do you think I would allow my son—
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  _Our_ son.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  My son [LORD ILLINGWORTH _shrugs his shoulders_]—to go
           away with the man who spoiled my youth, who ruined my life, who has
           tainted every moment of my days?  You don’t realise what my past has been
           in suffering and in shame.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  My dear Rachel, I must candidly say that I think
           Gerald’s future considerably more important than your past.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  Gerald cannot separate his future from my past.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  That is exactly what he should do.  That is exactly
           what you should help him to do.  What a typical woman you are!  You talk
           sentimentally, and you are thoroughly selfish the whole time.  But don’t
           let us have a scene.  Rachel, I want you to look at this matter from the
           common-sense point of view, from the point of view of what is best for
           our son, leaving you and me out of the question.  What is our son at
           present?  An underpaid clerk in a small Provincial Bank in a third-rate
           English town.  If you imagine he is quite happy in such a position, you
           are mistaken.  He is thoroughly discontented.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  He was not discontented till he met you.  You have made
           him so.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Of course, I made him so.  Discontent is the first
           step in the progress of a man or a nation.  But I did not leave him with
           a mere longing for things he could not get.  No, I made him a charming
           offer.  He jumped at it, I need hardly say.  Any young man would.  And
           now, simply because it turns out that I am the boy’s own father and he my
           own son, you propose practically to ruin his career.  That is to say, if
           I were a perfect stranger, you would allow Gerald to go away with me, but
           as he is my own flesh and blood you won’t.  How utterly illogical you
           are!
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not allow him to go.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  How can you prevent it?  What excuse can you give to
           him for making him decline such an offer as mine?  I won’t tell him in
           what relations I stand to him, I need hardly say.  But you daren’t tell
           him.  You know that.  Look how you have brought him up.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have brought him up to be a good man.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Quite so.  And what is the result?  You have educated
           him to be your judge if he ever finds you out.  And a bitter, an unjust
           judge he will be to you.  Don’t be deceived, Rachel.  Children begin by
           loving their parents.  After a time they judge them.  Rarely, if ever, do
           they forgive them.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  George, don’t take my son away from me.  I have had
           twenty years of sorrow, and I have only had one thing to love me, only
           one thing to love.  You have had a life of joy, and pleasure, and
           success.  You have been quite happy, you have never thought of us.  There
           was no reason, according to your views of life, why you should have
           remembered us at all.  Your meeting us was a mere accident, a horrible
           accident.  Forget it.  Don’t come now, and rob me of . . . of all I have
           in the whole world.  You are so rich in other things.  Leave me the
           little vineyard of my life; leave me the walled-in garden and the well of
           water; the ewe-lamb God sent me, in pity or in wrath, oh! leave me that.
           George, don’t take Gerald from me.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Rachel, at the present moment you are not necessary to
           Gerald’s career; I am.  There is nothing more to be said on the subject.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I will not let him go.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Here is Gerald.  He has a right to decide for himself.
           
           [_Enter_ GERALD.]
           
           GERALD.  Well, dear mother, I hope you have settled it all with Lord
           Illingworth?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have not, Gerald.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Your mother seems not to like your coming with me, for
           some reason.
           
           GERALD.  Why, mother?
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I thought you were quite happy here with me, Gerald.  I
           didn’t know you were so anxious to leave me.
           
           GERALD.  Mother, how can you talk like that?  Of course I have been quite
           happy with you.  But a man can’t stay always with his mother.  No chap
           does.  I want to make myself a position, to do something.  I thought you
           would have been proud to see me Lord Illingworth’s secretary.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I do not think you would be suitable as a private
           secretary to Lord Illingworth.  You have no qualifications.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  I don’t wish to seem to interfere for a moment, Mrs.
           Arbuthnot, but as far as your last objection is concerned, I surely am
           the best judge.  And I can only tell you that your son has all the
           qualifications I had hoped for.  He has more, in fact, than I had even
           thought of.  Far more.  [MRS. ARBUTHNOT _remains silent_.]  Have you any
           other reason, Mrs. Arbuthnot, why you don’t wish your son to accept this
           post?
           
           GERALD.  Have you, mother?  Do answer.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you have, Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray, pray say it.  We
           are quite by ourselves here.  Whatever it is, I need not say I will not
           repeat it.
           
           GERALD.  Mother?
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  If you would like to be alone with your son, I will
           leave you.  You may have some other reason you don’t wish me to hear.
           
           MRS. ARBUTHNOT.  I have no other reason.
           
           LORD ILLINGWORTH.  Then, my dear boy, we may look on the thing as
           settled.  Come, you and I will smoke a cigarette on the terrace together.
           And Mrs. Arbuthnot, pray let me tell you, that I think you have acted
           very, very wisely.
           
           [_Exit with_ GERALD.  MRS. ARBUTHNOT _is left alone_.  _She stands
           immobile with a look of unutterable sorrow on her face_.]
